## 5. Repeat Infringer Policy

VidChain maintains a policy for terminating accounts of repeat infringers.

### Strike Tracking

| Strikes | Action |
|---------|--------|
| 1st valid DMCA | Warning + content removal |
| 2nd valid DMCA | 30-day upload restriction |
| 3rd valid DMCA | Account termination |

### Considerations

- Counter-notifications that result in restoration do not count as strikes
- Egregious or willful infringement may result in immediate termination
- Strikes expire after 12 months of good standing
- Account termination includes:
  - Removal of all content
  - Freeze of marketplace activity
  - NFT ownership remains on blockchain but platform features disabled

---

## 6. NFT-Specific Considerations

### Content Removal vs. NFT Ownership

- DMCA takedown **removes platform visibility** of the video
- NFT **ownership on blockchain is immutable** and cannot be removed by VidChain
- NFT **marketplace listing is suspended** during DMCA process
- NFT **metadata on IPFS** may be flagged but cannot be deleted from decentralized storage

### Remedies for NFT Copyright Claims

1. **Platform Removal**: Video hidden from VidChain platform
2. **Marketplace Suspension**: NFT cannot be listed or sold on VidChain marketplace
3. **Metadata Warning**: Warning label added to NFT metadata where possible
4. **Buyer Notification**: Existing NFT owners notified of claim

### Smart Contract Considerations

- Original creator royalties continue per smart contract terms
- Platform cannot modify on-chain ownership or royalty settings
- Off-chain licensing terms may be invalidated by valid DMCA claim

---

## 7. Misrepresentation Liability

### Warning to Complainants

Under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any person who knowingly materially misrepresents:
- That material is infringing, or
- That material was removed by mistake

**May be liable for damages**, including costs and attorney's fees incurred by VidChain or the alleged infringer.

### Common Fair Use Considerations

Before filing a takedown, consider whether the use may be fair use:
- Commentary or criticism
- News reporting
- Educational use
- Parody or satire
- Transformative works

---

## 8. International Considerations

### Non-US Copyright Holders

- VidChain applies DMCA procedures globally for consistency
- We also comply with EU Copyright Directive where applicable
- Local laws may provide additional remedies

### Notice and Takedown Outside DMCA

For jurisdictions without DMCA equivalent:
- Submit takedown request with proof of copyright ownership
- Include authorization to act on behalf of rights holder
- Provide clear identification of infringing content

---

## 9. Record Keeping
